# datomic-fundamentals

The goal of this repo is to document practicing exercises while learning datomic!

I'm basing my knowledge on the following references

* Datomic Team. [Day of Datomic Video Series. Parts I-IV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_gRBIT1tUc)
* Datomic Team. [Datomic Client API Documentation](https://docs.datomic.com/cloud/client/client-api.html)

## Project structure

This is a leiningen project, and the core name space has the same name as the repo.
All related notes are contained in the `doc` folder.

## How to run source code

Clearly, datomic needs to be installed in the hosting machine. Also, I'm using
IntelliJ CE, with Cursive, so most of the things I will run using the REPL!
